This code represents a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) `MainWindow` class that interacts with a `PatientViewModel` to handle patient registrations and appointment confirmations. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

### 1. Class Declaration and Field Initialization

```csharp
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    private PatientViewModel _viewModel;
```

- `MainWindow` is a class that inherits from `Window`, making it the main window in a WPF application.
- `_viewModel` is a private field of type `PatientViewModel`. It acts as the data context for `MainWindow`, managing patient data and raising events for specific actions like registration and appointment confirmation.

### 2. Constructor

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    _viewModel = new PatientViewModel();
    _viewModel.OnPatientRegistered += OnPatientRegistered;
    _viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed += OnAppointmentConfirmed;

    // Unsubscribe when window is closed
    this.Closed += (s, e) => UnsubscribeEvents();
}
```

- **`InitializeComponent()`**: This method initializes the components defined in the XAML for `MainWindow`.
- **`_viewModel = new PatientViewModel();`**: Creates a new instance of `PatientViewModel` and assigns it to `_viewModel`.
- **Event Subscriptions**:
  - `_viewModel.OnPatientRegistered += OnPatientRegistered;` subscribes the `OnPatientRegistered` method in `MainWindow` to the `OnPatientRegistered` event in `PatientViewModel`.
  - `_viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed += OnAppointmentConfirmed;` subscribes `OnAppointmentConfirmed` to `OnAppointmentConfirmed`.
- **Unsubscribing on Window Closed**:
  - `this.Closed += (s, e) => UnsubscribeEvents();` attaches an event handler to the `Closed` event of the `MainWindow`.
  - When the `Closed` event is triggered (i.e., the window is completely closed), it calls `UnsubscribeEvents()` to detach event handlers, preventing potential memory leaks.

### 3. Event Unsubscription

```csharp
private void UnsubscribeEvents()
{
    _viewModel.OnPatientRegistered -= OnPatientRegistered;
    _viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed -= OnAppointmentConfirmed;
}
```

- This method is responsible for unsubscribing `MainWindow` event handlers from the events in `PatientViewModel`.
- By unsubscribing, it helps release any references between `MainWindow` and `_viewModel` that could prevent garbage collection, ensuring proper cleanup.

### 4. Event Handlers

#### `OnAppointmentConfirmed`

```csharp
private void OnAppointmentConfirmed(object sender, Patient e)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Appointment confirmed successfully.");
}
```

- This method handles the `OnAppointmentConfirmed` event from `PatientViewModel`.
- When an appointment is confirmed, it displays a message box to notify the user with the message "Appointment confirmed successfully."

#### `OnPatientRegistered`

```csharp
private void OnPatientRegistered(object sender, Patient patient)
{
    MessageBox.Show($"Patient {patient.Name} registered!", "Registration Success", MessageBoxButton.OK, MessageBoxImage.Information);
}
```

- This method handles the `OnPatientRegistered` event from `PatientViewModel`.
- When a patient is registered, it displays a message box with the patientâ€™s name, confirming the registration and displaying "Registration Success" as the title.

### Summary

- **Purpose**: The code sets up a main window that listens to events from a `PatientViewModel` to provide feedback (via message boxes) for patient registration and appointment confirmation.
- **Memory Management**: By subscribing and unsubscribing from events appropriately, it ensures efficient memory usage and prevents potential memory leaks.
- **User Notifications**: Event handlers notify the user of actions performed on patient data through message boxes. 

This setup follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, where the `PatientViewModel` acts as the ViewModel, and `MainWindow` is the View, which interacts with the ViewModel through events.
///////
In your code, unsubscribing from events plays a critical role in memory management, particularly in preventing memory leaks. Below is a more detailed explanation of how unsubscription happens and why it's important:

### 1. **Event Subscription**

When the `MainWindow` is initialized, you subscribe to the events of the `PatientViewModel`:

```csharp
_viewModel.OnPatientRegistered += OnPatientRegistered;
_viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed += OnAppointmentConfirmed;
```

Here, you're adding the `OnPatientRegistered` and `OnAppointmentConfirmed` methods in `MainWindow` as event handlers for the respective events in `PatientViewModel`. Subscribing means that when those events are triggered (e.g., when a patient is registered or an appointment is confirmed), your event handler methods in `MainWindow` will be executed.

### 2. **Why Unsubscribe?**

Unsubscribing from events is necessary for several reasons:

- **Memory Leaks**: In C#, events can prevent the garbage collection (GC) of objects that are no longer needed. When an object subscribes to an event, it creates a reference between the event publisher (e.g., `PatientViewModel`) and the event subscriber (e.g., `MainWindow`). If the subscriber is not unsubscribed, the event publisher holds a reference to it, preventing the garbage collector from releasing the subscriber's resources, even if the subscriber (like `MainWindow`) is no longer in use. This leads to a **memory leak**.
  
- **Avoiding Redundant Execution**: If you do not unsubscribe, even after closing the window, the event handlers might still be called if the event is triggered, leading to unnecessary operations or UI changes, which can be inefficient.

### 3. **Event Unsubscription**

To avoid these issues, you're unsubscribing from the events when the `MainWindow` is closed:

```csharp
this.Closed += (s, e) => UnsubscribeEvents();
```

Here, you attach an event handler to the `Closed` event of the `MainWindow`. When the window is closed, the `Closed` event is triggered, and the `UnsubscribeEvents()` method is called. This method removes the event handlers from the events, ensuring that `MainWindow` no longer listens for the events in `PatientViewModel`.

### 4. **How Unsubscribing Works**

```csharp
private void UnsubscribeEvents()
{
    _viewModel.OnPatientRegistered -= OnPatientRegistered;
    _viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed -= OnAppointmentConfirmed;
}
```

- The `OnPatientRegistered -= OnPatientRegistered;` line removes the `OnPatientRegistered` method from the `OnPatientRegistered` event.
- Similarly, the `OnAppointmentConfirmed -= OnAppointmentConfirmed;` line removes the `OnAppointmentConfirmed` method from the `OnAppointmentConfirmed` event.

After this method is executed, the `MainWindow` will no longer react to the events from `PatientViewModel`, and the references between `MainWindow` and `PatientViewModel` will be cleared, allowing the garbage collector to clean up any unused objects.

### 5. **Final Thoughts**

By unsubscribing from events in the `Closed` event handler, you ensure that:

- No memory is unnecessarily retained by the event subscriptions.
- The event handlers will not be invoked after the window is closed, which is important for user experience and resource management.
- You follow best practices for working with events in C# to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions.

This practice is particularly important in WPF, where objects like windows and view models can live longer than expected if not properly cleaned up.
