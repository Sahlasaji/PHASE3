Models: The PatientModel class holds the data for each patient.
ViewModel: The PatientViewModel manages the application state, handles commands, and raises events to notify the UI of changes.
Commands: The RelayCommand class allows for easy binding of UI actions (like button clicks) to methods in the ViewModel.
User Controls: Each user control (e.g., PatientRegistrationControl, AppointmentControl, PatientDashboardControl) is responsible for a specific part of the UI and interacts with the ViewModel to display and update data.
Event Handling: Events like PatientRegistered and AppointmentUpdated facilitate communication between the ViewModel and the user controls, allowing them to respond to changes in the application state.
Conclusion
The Patient Admission Application effectively demonstrates the MVVM pattern by separating concerns between the UI (View), the data (Model), and the logic (ViewModel). This structure allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability of the application.

User Experience: The application provides a smooth user experience by allowing users to register patients, confirm appointments, and view patient information through a clean and organized interface.
Data Binding: WPF's data binding capabilities are leveraged to keep the UI in sync with the underlying data model, ensuring that changes in the ViewModel are automatically reflected in the UI.



Workflow Overview
The Patient Admission Application is designed to manage patient registrations, appointment confirmations, and provide a dashboard for viewing patient information. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, which separates the user interface from the business logic, making the application easier to maintain and test.

Key Components
Model (PatientModel):

Represents a patient with properties such as Name, Age, Dateofbirth, Address, BookingDate, AppointmentDate, ConfirmationStatus, and Slot.
This class serves as the data structure for patient information.

RelayCommand:

        add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
        remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
    }
}
ViewModel (PatientViewModel):

Manages the state of the application and acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It contains commands for showing different views, registering patients, and sending updates.

public class PatientViewModel : BaseViewModel, IPatient

    }

    public void SendUpdate(object parameter)
    {
        // Logic to send updates for the selected patient
    }
}
User Controls:

PatientRegistrationControl: Handles patient registration. It collects patient information through input fields and binds the data to the NewPatient property in the ViewModel.
AppointmentControl: Displays registered patients and allows the user to confirm appointments. It binds to the Patients collection in the ViewModel.
PatientDashboardControl: Displays a dashboard with confirmed patients and their details.
Main Window
The MainWindow serves as the entry point of the application. It contains buttons for navigation and a content area to display different user controls based on user actions.

Certainly! Let's continue with the explanation of the MainWindow and how it integrates with the rest of the application.

Main Window (Continued)
The MainWindow contains a DockPanel that organizes the layout into a navigation area and a content area. The navigation area includes buttons that are bound to commands in the PatientViewModel, allowing users to switch between different functionalities of the application.

Hereâ€™s the complete XAML for the MainWindow:

Code Behind for MainWindow
In the code-behind file (MainWindow.xaml.cs), the MainWindow initializes the PatientViewModel and sets it as the DataContext. This allows the bindings in the XAML to access properties and commands defined in the ViewModel.

        DataContext = _viewModel; // Set the DataContext for binding
    }
}
Workflow of the Application
Application Start:

When the application starts, the MainWindow is displayed. The PatientViewModel is instantiated, and its commands are bound to the buttons in the navigation panel.
Navigating to Patient Registration:

When the user clicks the "Patient Registration" button, the ShowRegistrationCommand is executed. This command switches the content of the MainContent area to the PatientRegistrationControl, allowing the user to enter patient details.
csharp

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
private void ShowRegistration(object parameter)
{
    _mainWindow.MainContent.Content = registrationControl; // Switch to Registration control
}
Registering a Patient:

In the PatientRegistrationControl, the user fills out the patient details and clicks the "Register" button. This button is bound to the RegisterPatientCommand in the ViewModel.
The RegisterPatient method in the ViewModel is called, which validates the input and adds the new patient to the Patients collection.
csharp

        {
            Name = NewPatient.Name,
            Dateofbirth = NewPatient.Dateofbirth,
            Age = DateTime.Now.Year - NewPatient.Dateofbirth.Year,
            Address = NewPatient.Address,
            Slot = NewPatient.Slot,
            BookingDate = NewPatient.BookingDate
        });
        PatientUpdated?.Invoke(this, NewPatient); // Notify other controls
        NewPatient = new PatientModel(); // Reset for new entry
    }
    else
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Please provide valid patient details.");
    }
}
Appointment Confirmation:

After registration, the user can navigate to the "Appointment Confirmation" control. Here, they can select a registered patient and set the appointment date and confirmation status.
When the user clicks the "Send Update" button, the SendUpdateCommand is executed, which updates the selected patient's confirmation status and appointment date.

Certainly! Let's continue with the explanation of the workflow, particularly focusing on the appointment confirmation process and how the application handles updates and displays information.

Continuing the Workflow
Sending Appointment Updates:

When the user clicks the "Send Update" button in the AppointmentControl, the SendUpdateCommand is executed. This command updates the selected patient's confirmation status and appointment date.
csharp

Verify

Edit
Copy code
public void SendUpdate(object parameter)
{
    if (SelectedPatient != null)
    {
        SelectedPatient.ConfirmationStatus = NewPatient.ConfirmationStatus;
        SelectedPatient.AppointmentDate = NewPatient.AppointmentDate;
        AppointmentUpdated?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Notify that an appointment has been updated
    }
    else
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Please select a Patient");
    }
}
The AppointmentUpdated event is raised, which can be handled by other components (like the dashboard) to reflect the changes.
Handling Appointment Updates:

The OnAppointmentUpdated method is invoked when an appointment is confirmed. This method checks if the selected patient is not already in the ConfirmedPatients collection and adds them if they are not.
csharp

Copy code
private void OnAppointmentUpdated(object sender, EventArgs e)

    {
        ConfirmedPatients.Add(SelectedPatient); // Add to confirmed patients
        MessageBox.Show($"Appointment Confirmed for {SelectedPatient.Name}"); // Notify user
    }
}
Displaying Patient Information:

The PatientUpdated event is used to notify other controls (like AppointmentControl and PatientDashboardControl) when a patient is registered or updated. Each control has a method (DisplayPatientName) that updates the UI to reflect the latest patient information.

    }
}
Navigating to the Patient Dashboard:

When the user clicks the "Patient Dashboard" button, the ShowDashboardCommand is executed, which switches the content area to the PatientDashboardControl. This control displays a list of confirmed patients.
