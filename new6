The Patient Management System is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application designed to manage patient registrations and appointments. The application allows users to register patients, confirm appointments, and view a dashboard of confirmed patients. The architecture follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, which separates the user interface from the business logic.

Key Components
Model (Patient Class):

Represents a patient with properties such as Name, Age, DateOfBirth, Address, Slot, and BookingDate.
This class serves as the data structure for patient information.

    public string DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
    public string Slot { get; set; } 
    public string BookingDate { get; set; }
}
Interface (IPatient):

Defines the contract for patient management, including a collection of patients and a method to register a patient.

Copy code
public interface IPatient
{
    ObservableCollection<Patient> Patients { get; }
    void RegisterPatient(Patient patient);
}
ViewModel (PatientViewModel):

Implements the IPatient interface and manages the state of the application.
Contains collections for all patients and confirmed patients.
Handles patient registration and appointment confirmation, raising events to notify the view of changes.

public class PatientViewModel : IPatient
{
    public ObservableCollection<Patient> Patients { get; private set; }
    public ObservableCollection<Patient> ConfirmedPatients { get; private set; }
    // Other properties and methods...
}
Main Window (MainWindow.xaml and MainWindow.xaml.cs):

The main entry point of the application, containing buttons to navigate to different functionalities (registration, appointment confirmation, and dashboard).
Initializes the PatientViewModel and subscribes to events for patient registration and appointment confirmation.

Copy code
private void btnRegistration_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var patientRegControl = new PatientRegControl(_viewModel);
    MainContent.Content = patientRegControl;
}
User Controls:

PatientRegControl: Handles patient registration. It collects patient information through input fields and validates the data before registering the patient.
AppointmentConfirmationControl: Displays a list of registered patients and allows the user to confirm appointments. It updates the ConfirmedPatients collection in the PatientViewModel.
PatientDashboardControl: Displays the dashboard with a list of confirmed patients and the registration status message.
Workflow
Patient Registration:

The user clicks the "Register Patient" button in the main window.
The PatientRegControl is displayed, allowing the user to enter patient details.
Upon clicking the "Register" button, the input is validated, and if valid, a new Patient object is created and registered through the PatientViewModel.
The OnPatientRegistered event is raised, notifying the main window and updating the registration message.
Appointment Confirmation:

After registration, the user can navigate to the AppointmentConfirmationControl.
This control displays a list of registered patients, allowing the user to select patients for appointment confirmation.
When the "Confirm Appointment" button is clicked, the selected patients are moved to the ConfirmedPatients collection in the PatientViewModel, and the OnAppointmentConfirmed event is raised.
Patient Dashboard:

The user can navigate to the PatientDashboardControl to view the list of confirmed patients and the registration status message.
The dashboard updates automatically based on the data in the PatientViewModel.
Summary
The Patient Management System is a well-structured WPF application that utilizes the MVVM pattern to separate concerns and facilitate maintainability. The workflow allows users to register patients, confirm appointments, and view a dashboard, all while providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. 



Event handling is a fundamental concept in C# and is widely used in WPF applications to facilitate communication between different components, especially between the ViewModel and the View. In the context of your Patient Management System, event handling is used to notify the UI about changes in the state of the application, such as when a patient is registered or an appointment is confirmed.

How Event Handling is Used
Defining Events: In the PatientViewModel, events are defined to notify subscribers when certain actions occur. For example, when a patient is registered or an appointment is confirmed.

csharp

Copy code
public event EventHandler<Patient> OnPatientRegistered;
public event EventHandler<Patient> OnAppointmentConfirmed;
Raising Events: When a specific action occurs (like registering a patient), the corresponding event is raised. This is typically done at the end of a method that performs the action.

csharp

Copy code
public void RegisterPatient(Patient patient)
{
    Patients.Add(patient);
    // Raise an event for notification
    OnPatientRegistered?.Invoke(this, patient);
}
The ?.Invoke syntax is a null-conditional operator that ensures the event is only raised if there are subscribers (i.e., if the event is not null).

Subscribing to Events: In the MainWindow (or any other component that needs to respond to the event), you subscribe to the events defined in the PatientViewModel. This is typically done in the constructor of the MainWindow.

csharp

Copy code
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    _viewModel = new PatientViewModel();
    _viewModel.OnPatientRegistered += OnPatientRegistered;
    _viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed += OnAppointmentConfirmed;
}
Here, the OnPatientRegistered and OnAppointmentConfirmed methods are event handlers that will be called when the respective events are raised.

Handling Events: The event handlers are methods that define what should happen when the event is raised. For example, when a patient is registered, a message box can be shown to inform the user.

Copy code
private void OnPatientRegistered(object sender, Patient patient)
{
    MessageBox.Show($"Patient {patient.Name} registered!", "Registration Success", MessageBoxButton.OK, MessageBoxImage.Information);
}
Unsubscribing from Events
It's important to unsubscribe from events when they are no longer needed, especially in WPF applications, to prevent memory leaks and unintended behavior. This is typically done in the Unloaded event of the control or window.

csharp

Copy code
private void UnsubscribeEvents()
{
    _viewModel.OnPatientRegistered -= OnPatientRegistered;
    _viewModel.OnAppointmentConfirmed -= OnAppointmentConfirmed;
}
In the MainWindow constructor, you can subscribe to the events, and in the UnsubscribeEvents method, you can unsubscribe from them. This method can be called in the Closed event of the window:

Copy code
this.Closed += (s, e) => UnsubscribeEvents();
Summary
Event Handling: It allows components to communicate with each other without tightly coupling them. The ViewModel raises events to notify the View of changes.
Subscription: Components subscribe to events to receive notifications. This is done using the += operator.
Unsubscription: It's crucial to unsubscribe from events to avoid memory leaks and ensure that event handlers do not get called after the component is disposed of.
This pattern of event handling and subscription is a powerful way to manage interactions in WPF applications, promoting a clean separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. If you have any further questions or need clarification on specific aspects, feel free to ask!
